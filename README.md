In this project, my aim is to detect heart rate and ventricular fibrillation considering the article ‘Implementation
of a Simple Real-Time Algorithm for Ventricular Fibrillation Detection in a Microcontroller’ by implementing the proposed algorithm on Matlab.
Using the raw ECG data and this code, one can find out whether the patient is having heart attack or what is his/her heart rate. If heart rate is above than normal level, which is indicated as 60 to 100 per a minute in medical books, then the action should be taken.
